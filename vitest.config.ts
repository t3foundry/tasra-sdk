// `test/specs/*.test.ts` are thin wrappers around the self-contained suites in
// `test/*.ts` (see test/_runSuite.ts). Everything under test/e2e, test/fleet,
// test/reconcile, test/slashing, test/stress, test/verify, and test/economics
// needs a live fleet + chain and stays as standalone `tsx` CLIs — those are run
// via `npm run test:e2e`, `test:fleet`, `stress:*`, `verify:*`.
//
// test/pack-smoke.ts is also excluded: it runs `npm pack` and lays out a scratch
// consumer, which is packaging verification (`npm run verify:pkg`), not a unit test.

      //
      //   STRUCTURAL — `src/decryption` (~6%) and `src/slots` (0%) are HTTP orchestration
      //   against real keepers and a live faucet. They are covered by test/e2e, which
      //   needs a deployment and cannot run here. Low is expected, not neglect — but it
      //   does mean CI never exercises them, so a change there is caught only by running
      //   the live suite.
      //
      //   A REAL GAP — reachable with a stubbed `fetch`. THIS LIST IS NOW EMPTY. Every
      //   directory but the two structural ones above is at ~93% statements or better, and

      // Five files were the weakest in the package and are no longer: src/chain/client.ts
      // (~13% → 100%, every typed reader's contract+selector pinned), src/chain/write.ts
      // (~54% → ~98%, every wallet action's target+selector+args and which ones are relayed),
      // src/auth/verifier.ts (~48% → fully covered), src/chain/offchain.ts (~6% → fully
      // covered, every endpoint's URL plus the timeout that keeps an aggregator loop moving)
      // and src/chain/manifest.ts (~65% → 100%, `observeNetworkManifest` including the
      // swapped-implementation-behind-an-unchanged-proxy case it exists for).
      // Nothing structural had been in the way of any of it — only absent tests.

      // ⚠ WHAT IS LEFT IS MOSTLY UNREACHABLE, and is left alone on purpose. Deleting a
      // defensive guard in a crypto or slot-creation path to move a number is the wrong
      // trade, so these stay uncovered rather than being removed or forced:
      //
      //   • rejection-sampling retries — `randomScalar()` in ibe.ts and kem.ts loops only if a
      //     512-bit random reduces to exactly zero (p ≈ 2^-255).
      //   • zero-scalar and zero-Lagrange arms (frost.ts `mul`, kem.ts's `lambda !== 0n`): a
      //     Lagrange coefficient is never zero for distinct identifiers.
      //   • the `fulfilled` arm of the error-aggregation mappers in committee/client.ts: that
      //     mapper only runs when NOTHING fulfilled, so the branch cannot be taken.
      //   • `?? fallback` arms where the lookup table is built from the same array being
      //     indexed (committee/client.ts `verifiers[i]`, committee/request.ts `byIndex.get`).
      //   • the draw's selection cap (token.ts) and `compareBytes`'s equal-byte continue,
      //     which need crafted digests rather than a test.
      //   • src/chain/write.ts's `relayForward` with no relay and `policyTuple` with no
      //     policy — no caller in this package can reach either.
      //   • src/chain/events.ts's positional-args branch, unreachable while no vendored ABI
      //     has unnamed event params.
      //   • `(claims ?? [])` arms and `if (claims !== undefined)` in auth/oid4vp.ts: every
      //     credential query is REQUIRED to carry an ["iss"] entry, so `claims` is never
      //     undefined by the time those run.
      //   • auth/oid4vp.ts's hand-written integer-index check: the path grammar
      //     (`asClaimPath`) already refuses a numeric segment, so the later `some(typeof ===
      //     'number')` cannot fire. The comment above it says it is enforced by hand because
      //     "nothing else would notice" — something else does now.
      //   • `e instanceof Error` false arms around JSON.parse: it only ever throws SyntaxError.
      //
      // A redundant guard found this way has since been FIXED rather than left: session.ts's
      // `#reassemble` used to repeat `ensureFresh`'s JWT-renewal condition on a path nothing
      // could reach, so relaxing the skew in one place would have left the other enforcing the
      // old rule. Both now call one private `#renewJwtIfStale`, and session.ts went to 100%
      // statements/functions/lines as a result — the unreachable branches disappeared because
      // the duplication did, not because a test contorted its way into them.
