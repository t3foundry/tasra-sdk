# Advanced and compatibility reference

Read this only for a task explicitly routed here by the main skill. This preserves
existing lower-level capabilities; it is not the default new-application path.
Check the installed declarations and the deployment's operation support before
using an older route. Never fall back from refused request-bound authorization to
JWT/admin authorization. Retry advice here applies only when the operation is known
safe to repeat; it never authorizes blindly repeating transaction submissions,
native approval POSTs or signing requests with an uncertain outcome.

# `tasra-sdk/chain`

Everything on-chain, behind its own subpath so the crypto core stays free of
`viem` imports. The SDK installs viem automatically; declare it in your own
application dependencies only when your code imports viem directly.

## Public deployment manifest

A manifest is the record of a deployment — every contract, its address, its runtime
code hash and its proxy implementation. Configuring from one means no address is ever
copied by hand, and nothing loads that does not match its pin.

Canonical source: [t3-foundry/tasra-releases](https://github.com/t3-foundry/tasra-releases).
Fuji's [current pointer](https://github.com/t3-foundry/tasra-releases/blob/main/networks/testnet/current.json)
names `deployments/tasra-fuji-v1.json` and supplies `sha256`. Resolve that path
relative to `networks/testnet/`, not the repository root. Network records are
versioned by repository commit, independently of CLI binary release assets.

For an application, choose a reviewed commit from that repository and set
`TASRA_RELEASES_REF` to its full 40-character SHA. Fetch both files at that revision,
check HTTP status, and pass the original text to the parser; reserializing JSON
changes its digest. A trusted local checkout of the same revision works too.
The pointer's checksum protects the record only when you trust its source; hashing
an arbitrary download yourself does not establish authenticity.

Complete Node bootstrap (`npm install tasra-sdk@latest`):

```ts
import {
  parsePinnedNetworkManifest, addressBookFromManifest, createTasraChainClient,
  observeNetworkManifest, NETWORKS,
} from 'tasra-sdk/chain'

const revision = process.env.TASRA_RELEASES_REF
if (!revision || !/^[a-f0-9]{40}$/.test(revision)) throw new Error('Set TASRA_RELEASES_REF to a reviewed release-repository commit')
const base = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t3-foundry/tasra-releases/${revision}/networks/testnet/`
async function readText(url: string) {
  const response = await fetch(url, {signal: AbortSignal.timeout(15_000)})
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Release download failed: HTTP ${response.status}`)
  return response.text()
}
const pointer = JSON.parse(await readText(`${base}current.json`))
if (pointer.schemaVersion !== 1 || pointer.network !== 'testnet' ||
    pointer.chainId !== 43113 || pointer.status !== 'active' ||
    typeof pointer.manifest !== 'string' || !/^deployments\/[a-z0-9.-]+\.json$/.test(pointer.manifest)) {
  throw new Error('Expected an active Fuji deployment pointer')
}
const manifest = parsePinnedNetworkManifest(await readText(`${base}${pointer.manifest}`), pointer.sha256)
if (manifest.chainId !== pointer.chainId || manifest.network !== pointer.network || manifest.status !== pointer.status) {
  throw new Error('Pointer/manifest mismatch')
}
const addresses = addressBookFromManifest(manifest)
const rpcUrl = process.env.KK_RPC_URL ?? NETWORKS[manifest.network].rpcUrl
const chain = createTasraChainClient({rpcUrl, addresses, chainId: manifest.chainId})
const verifierAgentUrl = manifest.services.find(s => s.kind === 'verifier-agent')?.url
const observation = await observeNetworkManifest(manifest, rpcUrl)
if (!observation.matches) throw new Error('Deployment code does not match the pinned manifest')
```

To use a previously downloaded record with the SDK's live examples, set
`KK_MANIFEST_FILE`, `KK_MANIFEST_SHA256` (the pointer's trusted digest), and
`KK_RPC_URL`. The equivalent local-file setup is:

```ts
import {readFileSync} from 'node:fs'
import {parsePinnedNetworkManifest, addressBookFromManifest, createTasraChainClient, observeNetworkManifest} from 'tasra-sdk/chain'

const manifest  = parsePinnedNetworkManifest(readFileSync(path, 'utf8'), expectedSha256)
const addresses = addressBookFromManifest(manifest)
const chain     = createTasraChainClient({rpcUrl, addresses, chainId: manifest.chainId})
const obs       = await observeNetworkManifest(manifest, rpcUrl)   // {matches, contracts[], blockNumber}
```

Obtain the JSON and its SHA-256 from a verified release, never from a moving explorer
response, and never invent addresses from a network name. The digest is the whole
point: a file that does not hash to it throws
`Network manifest SHA-256 mismatch` before any network call.

- **Only `status: "active"` configures a live client.** Planned and retired records are
  for display; `addressBookFromManifest` will not give you a usable book from one.
- `observeNetworkManifest` compares finalized runtime code and proxy implementations
  with the record. It certifies **code identity only** — not service readiness,
  governance wiring or audit quality.
- **Read published endpoints from `services[]`.** Fuji's record includes
  `verifier-agent`, `relayer`, and `explorer` entries. The RPC comes from
  `NETWORKS[manifest.network].rpcUrl` or an explicit override; discover keepers
  and verifiers on-chain. Other records may have no services: report the missing
  endpoint rather than inventing one. Service URLs do not themselves establish a
  ServiceRegistry approval (see `tasra-create-slot/references/advanced.md`, "Gas: who pays").
  Keys and tokens are never in the manifest. Missing contract entries must be
  supplied by a reviewed release record before the corresponding operation is used.
- Regenerate it whenever the deployment changes: the addresses move and the old digest
  stops verifying, which is the behaviour you want.

The public package ships `dist/chain/manifest.d.ts` and the other declarations;
no private source checkout is needed.

## Address book and read client

```ts
import {createTasraChainClient, addressBookFromManifest, addressBookFromObject, requireAddress, NETWORKS} from 'tasra-sdk/chain'

// manifest is downloaded from tasra-releases and verified against its trusted checksum.
const addresses = addressBookFromManifest(manifest)
const chainId = manifest.chainId
const chain = createTasraChainClient({rpcUrl, addresses, chainId, logWindow: 1_000})   // at or under the RPC's getLogs cap
```

Slot ids everywhere in this subpath are the bytes32 id as a `0x…` hex string
(viem `Hex`), never a number or bigint.

`requireAddress(book, 'KeyRegistry')` throws with the known keys when one is
missing. `NETWORKS` holds RPC and chain presets. Use the downloaded manifest's
chain ID explicitly; the constructor does not query the RPC to confirm it.
Keep `logWindow` within the selected RPC's `getLogs` limit.
Construction is offline — it only configures viem; the first read is the first
RPC call, and a missing address throws there rather than at construction.

## Reading

```ts
const slot  = await chain.readers.keyRegistry.getKeySlot(slotId)
const nodes = await chain.readers.keyRegistry.assignedNodes(slotId)
const ops   = await chain.readers.nodeRegistry.activeOperators()
const bal   = await chain.readers.settlement.balanceOf(slotId)
const keeps = await chain.readers.nodeRegistry.hasTag(ops[0], keccak256(toHex('keykeeper')))  // role tag
const policy = await chain.readers.keyRegistry.verifierPolicy(slotId)   // [committee, quorum]; 0 = unset
const cr    = await chain.readers.keyRegistry.requiresCommitReveal()    // which createSlot call the registry takes
```

Reader namespaces: `nodeRegistry`, `keyRegistry`, `settlement`, `token`,
`bondingCurve`, `treasury`, `vault`, `beacon`, `verifierSet`. They live under
`chain.readers.*` — `chain.keyRegistry` does not exist.

`activeOperators()` is the whole fleet; a slot's committee is drawn only from the
operators carrying its tag, so the pool a new slot can use is
`activeOperators().filter(hasTag)` — count it before choosing `n`
(`tasra-create-slot`):

```ts
const tag = keccak256(toHex('keykeeper'))                    // createSlot's default tag
const eligible = []
for (const op of await chain.readers.nodeRegistry.activeOperators())
  if (await chain.readers.nodeRegistry.hasTag(op, tag)) eligible.push(op)
```
`chain.read(contract, fn, args)` and `chain.readMany(...)` cover the rest;
concurrent reads are batched through Multicall3. `chain.client` is the
underlying viem `PublicClient` and `chain.addresses` the resolved book.

Events: `chain.getLogsWindowed({fromBlock, toBlock, contracts?, onWindow?})`
walks a range in windows and returns `DecodedEvent[]` — `{category, contract,
address, eventName, args, blockNumber, blockHash, txHash, txIndex, logIndex}`;
`contracts` takes PascalCase book names; block numbers are viem `bigint`s, and
`onWindow(toBlock, events)` fires per window. The range is inclusive at both
ends, so for the last N blocks take `const head = await chain.getBlockNumber()`,
then `fromBlock = head >= N - 1n ? head - (N - 1n) : 0n` and `toBlock = head` —
a young chain has fewer blocks than you asked for. `decodeContractLogs`,
`categoryFor`, `eventNamesOf` and `jsonSafe` support explorer-style tooling:
`jsonSafe(value)` is not a stringifier, it returns a copy with every `bigint`
turned into a string, so hand its result to `JSON.stringify`.
`chain.getBlockTimestamps(blockNumbers)` batches timestamps.

## Discovery

```ts
import {resolveSlotKeeperUrls, resolveVerifierDirectory, resolveSlotGroupKey, VERIFIER_TAG} from 'tasra-sdk/chain'

const keeperUrls = await resolveSlotKeeperUrls(chain, slotId)   // assignedNodes → NodeRegistry.nodeOf(op).url
const verifiers  = await resolveVerifierDirectory(chain)         // CommitteeVerifier[] {index, url, operator?, pubkey?}, by ascending address
const {publicKey, epoch, mode} = await resolveSlotGroupKey(chain, slotId)   // mode: number, 0 = frost, 1 = bls; epoch: number
```

`VERIFIER_TAG` is `keccak256("verifier")`, the `NodeRegistry` role tag
`resolveVerifierDirectory` selects on. Address-book entries these need:
`resolveSlotKeeperUrls` reads `KeyRegistry` + `NodeRegistry`,
`resolveVerifierDirectory` only `NodeRegistry`, `resolveSlotGroupKey` only
`KeyRegistry`; `createTasraSlotClient` uses the first two. The committee path
also reads `ThresholdRandomBeacon` and `VerifierSetRegistry` (`tasra-committee-path`).

Network-service HTTP readers (`import {nodeApi, verifierApi, parsePrometheus} from 'tasra-sdk/chain'`)
are plain objects of functions taking the base URL:
`nodeApi.info(nodeUrl)` (`version`, `peer_id`, `node_identifier` — the node's BLS
identifier — and feature gates such as `admin_scope_enabled`; fields are
snake_case as the node returns them, and every one of them is optional in
`NodeInfo`, so narrow before using a value), `nodeApi.keys(nodeUrl)`, `nodeApi.metering(nodeUrl, id)`,
`verifierApi.info(verifierUrl)`, and `parsePrometheus(text)` for metrics.
These take the URL you pass; `rewriteUrl` belongs to the slot client and does not
reach them, so apply the same mapping yourself to a discovered URL first.

## The slot-driven client

```ts
import {createTasraSlotClient} from 'tasra-sdk/chain'

const kk = createTasraSlotClient({
  chain,
  identity: 'did:example:alice',   // this holder's DID (KK_IDENTITY in the other skills)
  rewriteUrl: u => u.replace('tasra-node-', 'nodes.example.com/node-'),  // in-cluster → reachable,
                                   // applied to both the keeper URLs and the chosen verifier
  onResolve: r => console.log(r.verifier, r.nodes),
})
const s = await kk.openSession(slotId, {renewalToken})   // same Session API as createTasraClient
await s.close()                                           // kk.closeAll() closes every session
```

It reads the slot's keepers from chain and chooses the verifier from the
on-chain verifier set; that verifier mints the JWT. The `Session` and the auth
modes are described in the compatibility reference for
`tasra-credentials-and-sessions`. `identity` is optional for `{jwt}` and
`{renewalToken}` — the token already names the holder — and required for
`{redemptionToken}` and `{vpJwt}`, which throw without it.

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting to declare viem when your own app imports it directly. The SDK
  installs viem for its own adapters; SDK-only consumers need no separate declaration.
- Assuming on-chain node URLs are reachable from your network. They are
  often in-cluster names; use `rewriteUrl` for the slot client, and the same
  mapping by hand for `nodeApi`/`verifierApi` calls.
- Huge `getLogs` ranges on a public RPC. Set `logWindow` under the cap.
- Serialising reader results with `JSON.stringify`. Values are `bigint`;
  use `JSON.stringify(jsonSafe(value))`.
- Passing `number` block ranges to `getLogsWindowed`. Use `bigint`.
