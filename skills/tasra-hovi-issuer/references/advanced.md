# Advanced and compatibility reference

Read this only for a task explicitly routed here by the main skill. This preserves
existing lower-level capabilities; it is not the default new-application path.
Check the installed declarations and the deployment's operation support before
using an older route. Never fall back from refused request-bound authorization to
JWT/admin authorization. Retry advice here applies only when the operation is known
safe to repeat; it never authorizes blindly repeating transaction submissions,
native approval POSTs or signing requests with an uncertain outcome.

# Getting credentials from Hovi

Nothing credential-gated in Tasra runs without an issuer: `vpJwt`
sessions, the committee path, the Verifier Agent and the wallet flow all present
verifiable credentials. Hovi is the issuer and wallet platform the SDK's
OpenID4VC implementation mirrors, and Hovi is an optional external issuer integration. Everything here is Hovi's API, not the SDK's;
the SDK enters at the end, when the holder receives the credential.

Facts marked *observed* were true for a trial account on 2026-09-11 and may
change with Hovi's plans.

## 0. Do you need Hovi at all?

- **Unit tests and local demos:** `issueSdJwtVc` in `tasra-sdk/oid4vp`
  issues a valid SD-JWT VC offline from a key you generate (see
  `tasra-oid4vp-wallet-and-verifier-agent`). No account needed.
- **An explicitly selected Hovi-hosted wallet or issuer:** the integration below.
- **Hovi-compatible without the cloud:** a local implementation of the same
  API subset exists in the platform's health demo (`/api/issuer`, keys start
  with `openId-local-`); the client below works against it by changing the
  base URL, and the trial limits do not apply there.

## 1. Trial account

1. Open `https://studio.hovi.id/`, click **Get started**, create the account.
2. *Observed trial limits:* **2 organizations, 1 credential template each**,
   and **credential revocation disabled** (`POST /credential/revoke` answers
   403 "not available during the trial period"). Exceeding a limit answers
   403 with a message containing "limit exceeded".

## 2. Organization and issuer DID

In Studio: **Organizations → Create Organization**. On creation the
organization's secret and DID seed phrase are shown **once**; copy them.

Or through the API:

```http
POST https://api.hovi.id/organization/create
Authorization: Bearer <OPENID_ECOSYSTEM_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{"name": "Acme HR", "label": "acme-hr", "secret": "<your secret>", "imageUrl": "https://…/logo.png"}
```

The 201 response carries the organization id, a tenant id, an access token and
the organization's DIDs, each with its private key — returned **only in this
response**. Store it like a signing key. `GET /organization/` lists your
organizations without secrets:

```json
{"success": true, "response": [{
  "organizationId": "ff64…", "tenantId": "…", "name": "Acme HR",
  "dids": [{"did": "did:key:zDna…", "method": "key"}],
  "openIdWellKnownCredentialIssuerUrl": "https://core-agent.hovi.id/oid4vci/ff64…/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer"
}]}
```

The organization's first DID is the **issuer DID**: it is what a Tasra
rule pins with `{"path": ["iss"], "values": ["<issuer DID>"]}`. It is the same
value that later appears as the credential's `iss` claim; decoding that claim
is a check, not a second source.

## 3. API key and request shape

Studio → **API Keys** → *Active API Keys*. Use the **OpenID ecosystem** key;
it starts with `openId-`. Every call:

- `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
- `x-organization-id: <organization id>` on every call except `/organization/*`
- base URL `https://api.hovi.id`; configure your app with `HOVI_API_KEY`, an
  optional `HOVI_BASE_URL` (the local Hovi-compatible issuer, for instance), and
  the organization and template it works with — the demo deployment's env names
  them `HOVI_ORGANIZATION_NAME` (matched against `GET /organization/`, whose
  `organizationId` is the header value) and `HOVI_TEMPLATE_SCHEMA_TYPE` (a
  template's `schemaType`)
- JSON envelope in every reply: `{"success": true, "response": …}` or
  `{"success": false, "message": "…"}`; check `success`, not only the status.

Keep the key server-side. It is an issuance authority; anyone holding it can
mint credentials your slots trust.

## 4. Credential template

One template per credential type. Its `schemaType` becomes the SD-JWT `vct`
that a DCQL rule matches; use `dc+sd-jwt`, and give every attribute a type
(`string`, `number`, `list`). Give credentials a numeric `exp` claim in Unix
seconds — declare `exp` among the template's attributes, since `credentialValues`
fills those. Rules need not mention it: a wallet drops an expired credential
from its plan before the rule is evaluated.

```http
POST https://api.hovi.id/credential-template/sd-jwt/create
Authorization: Bearer <key>
x-organization-id: <organization id>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Acme Employee",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "schemaType": "EmployeeOf",
  "description": "Employment credential issued by Acme HR",
  "sdJwtHeader": "dc+sd-jwt",
  "supportRevocation": true,
  "attributes": [
    {"name": "dept",  "label": "Department", "type": "string", "description": "Department", "required": true},
    {"name": "level", "label": "Level",      "type": "number", "description": "Seniority",  "required": true},
    {"name": "exp",   "label": "Expires at", "type": "number", "description": "Unix seconds", "required": true}
  ]
}
```

The response is the template; `GET /credential-template/organization` (with
the organization header) lists them:

```json
{"success": true, "response": [{
  "credentialTemplateId": "ede0…", "credentialConfigurationId": "…", "tenantId": "ff64…",
  "name": "Acme Employee", "schemaType": "EmployeeOf", "type": "sd-jwt", "sdJwtHeader": "dc+sd-jwt",
  "supportRevocation": true,
  "attributes": [{"name": "dept", "type": "string", "required": true}, {"name": "exp", "type": "number", "required": true},
                 {"name": "holderDid", "type": "string", "required": false}]
}]}
```

Templates may carry an optional `holderDid` attribute; fill it at issuance to
pin the credential to one holder, which means the holder key has to exist
first — `randomHolderKey()` (§5), then `holderDid: holder.did`. Studio's
**Credential Templates → Create Template** does the same by hand.

## 5. Issue a credential

```http
POST https://api.hovi.id/credential/sd-jwt/offer
Authorization: Bearer <key>
x-organization-id: <organization id>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "credentialTemplateId": "<template id>",
  "credentialValues": {"dept": "Engineering", "level": 3, "exp": 1790000000},
  "codeflow": "pre-authorized"
}
```

The response looks like this (ids shortened; the `//` notes are not part of it):

```jsonc
{"success": true, "response": {
  "credentialExchangeId": "b1f0…",                                   // the handle for find and revoke — keep it
  "credentialOfferUri": "openid-credential-offer://?credential_offer_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcore-agent.hovi.id%2F…",
  "credentialOfferUrl": "https://…/qr/…",                            // a page showing the QR for a wallet
  "state": "pending", "isRevoked": false, "credentialType": "EmployeeOf"
}}
```

The offer is not the credential; a wallet redeems the offer URI. The exchange
state is `pending` until then and `done` once a wallet has redeemed it. `GET /credential/find?credentialExchangeId=…` returns an
**array**: `[{"credentialExchangeId": "…", "state": "done", "isRevoked": false}]`.

### The holder receives it with the SDK

```ts
import {randomHolderKey, receiveCredential} from 'tasra-sdk/oid4vp'

const holder = randomHolderKey()                                   // or the holder's persisted P-256 key
const {credential, issuer, format, configurationId} = await receiveCredential({offerUri: offer.credentialOfferUri, holder})
// credential: the compact SD-JWT VC (dc+sd-jwt) bound to holder.did
// issuer: the OpenID4VCI credential_issuer URL — NOT the DID. The issuer DID a rule pins is the
// credential's `iss` claim (the JWS `kid` carries it too): decode the first ~-separated segment.
const issuerDid = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(credential.split('~')[0]!.split('.')[1]!, 'base64url').toString()).iss as string   // throws on a malformed string
```

`receiveCredential` runs the OpenID4VCI pre-authorized flow the Hovi Wallet
runs: offer, issuer metadata, token, proof of possession, credential. It follows
whatever URLs the offer and the issuer metadata carry, `http://` included, so
the local Hovi-compatible issuer needs no opt-in: `ReceiveCredentialOpts` has no
switch for it, and `allowInsecureLoopback` belongs to `did:web` resolution on
the presentation side. A human with the Hovi Wallet scans the QR page from the
offer response instead.

## 6. Use it against Tasra

Write the slot rule for the template, pinning the issuer:

```json
{"credentials": [{
  "id": "e", "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
  "meta": {"vct_values": ["EmployeeOf"]},
  "claims": [{"path": ["iss"], "values": ["<issuer DID>"]}, {"path": ["dept"], "values": ["Engineering"]}]
}]}
```

Validate and canonicalise the rule string with `validateDcql` /
`canonicalizeDcql` from `tasra-sdk` (see `tasra-dcql-rules`; every
DCQL function takes the rule as a JSON string), and check the credential you
received against it before relying on it:

```ts
import {evaluateDcql} from 'tasra-sdk'
import {parseSdJwt, sdJwtCredentialView} from 'tasra-sdk/oid4vp'

// The view's `types` is [vct]; its claims are the issuer payload plus every disclosure, so `dept` resolves
// at ["dept"]. Build it with this, never by hand: a disclosed claim is not in the issuer JWT's payload.
const ok = evaluateDcql(rule, [sdJwtCredentialView(parseSdJwt(credential))])
```

Then either open a session with it —
`kk.openSession(slotId, {vpJwt: {dcqlRule, credentials: [credential], holderProof}})`
(`tasra-credentials-and-sessions`) — or let a wallet present it to the
Verifier Agent (`tasra-oid4vp-wallet-and-verifier-agent`), or use the committee path
(`tasra-committee-path`). The keepers accept the credential because the
verified issuer matches the rule; Hovi's own status lists
(`https://revocation.hovi.id`, `statuslist+jwt`) are **not** checked by the
SDK, so an application that needs revocation must verify them itself.

## Minimal server-side client (yours, not the SDK's)

```ts
async function hovi<T>(baseUrl: string, key: string, path: string, org?: string, body?: unknown): Promise<T> {
  const r = await fetch(baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, '') + path, {
    method: body === undefined ? 'GET' : 'POST', redirect: 'error', signal: AbortSignal.timeout(20_000),
    headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${key}`, Accept: 'application/json', ...(org ? {'x-organization-id': org} : {}), ...(body !== undefined ? {'Content-Type': 'application/json'} : {})},
    body: body === undefined ? undefined : JSON.stringify(body),
  })
  const text = await r.text()   // not r.json(): a wrong base URL answers HTML, and a SyntaxError loses the status
  let env: {success?: boolean; message?: string; response?: T}
  try { env = JSON.parse(text) } catch { throw new Error(`Hovi ${path} → HTTP ${r.status}, not JSON: ${text.slice(0, 200)}`) }
  if (!r.ok || env.success !== true) throw new Error(`Hovi ${path} → HTTP ${r.status}: ${env.message ?? ''}`)
  return env.response as T
}
```

## Common mistakes

- Using a key from another ecosystem. Only the OpenID key (`openId-…`)
  serves this API.
- Omitting `x-organization-id` on template and credential calls.
- Treating the offer response as the credential. The wallet, or
  `receiveCredential`, redeems the offer URI.
- Expecting revocation on a trial account. It answers 403; plan the
  revocation test for a paid plan, or use time-boxed `exp` values meanwhile.
- Putting the API key in a browser bundle. Issue from a server.
- `exp` in milliseconds. It is Unix seconds, kept verbatim in the credential.
- Pinning the wrong DID. The issuer DID is the organization's DID from
  `GET /organization/`, not the holder's, not the tenant id.
- Creating a third organization or a second template per organization on
  the trial. It fails with "limit exceeded".
