# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this package follows
semantic versioning with one pre-1.0 caveat: a minor bump may change the API, a patch
never does.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `committeeSignEoaDigest` in `tasra-sdk/committee` for request-bound threshold
  Ethereum signing with verifier-agent compound tokens and membership proofs.
- SDK-only shared-account example that creates and provisions a local tECDSA slot,
  confirms Alice/Bob transactions, and verifies Mallory's server-side denial.
- Generated API reference, automatic documentation checks, fresh-install local-fleet
  acceptance command, and explicit SDK/deployment compatibility records.

### Changed

- The slot-provisioning example uses the creator's signature instead of an admin JWT.

### Fixed

- Point skills and onboarding docs to the published Fuji deployment pointer,
  manifest checksum and service URLs in `t3-foundry/tasra-releases`; document
  bootstrap from a pinned repository commit.
- Narrow slot-creation results before reading the transaction hash in the skill's
  direct/commit-reveal example.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Accept registered wallet Request Objects without `transaction_data`, while
  preserving operation and nonce binding checks. When `transaction_data` is present,
  continue to require exactly one entry matching the authorized operation, including
  its description.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Treat relay attempts with a consumed nonce outside the 10,000-block reconciliation
  window as terminal (`unresolvable`) and release the pending signer lock instead of
  retrying forever. Export the `RelayReconciliation` result type from `tasra-sdk/chain`.
  An unresolvable outcome does not prove that the operation failed; callers must check
  the resulting chain state before repeating the operation.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- Per-commitment accountant seeds for faster slot creation on compatible deployments,
  with beacon-epoch fallback when a seed is unavailable.
- `requestSlotSeed`, `resolveAccountantUrls`, `ACCOUNTANT_TAG`, and the
  `SlotSeed`, `SlotSeedOptions`, and `CommitRevealOptions` types in `tasra-sdk/chain`.
- Seed-request options and a `seeded` result flag on `createSlotCommitReveal`.

### Changed

- Commit/reveal slot creation tries a seeded reveal before waiting for the beacon.
  A failed seeded reveal through a relay propagates its error to preserve relay retries.
- KeyRegistry ABI includes seeded reveal methods, `commitSeedDigest`, and related
  events and errors.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release of `tasra-sdk`: a TypeScript access layer for the Tasra network.
