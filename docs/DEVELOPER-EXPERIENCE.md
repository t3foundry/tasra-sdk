# Developer experience: a live deployment + the released CLI + this SDK

For an application tutorial, start with the [shared-account tutorial](shared-account.md).
This page describes deployment responsibilities and acceptance requirements.
The current SDK/service version is not deployed on Fuji; use a compatible local
fleet for current live testing.

**Fuji deployment records are published** in
[tasra-releases](https://github.com/t3-foundry/tasra-releases):
`networks/testnet/current.json` points to `deployments/tasra-fuji-v1.json` and its
checksum. Pin both to the same reviewed repository commit; see
[prerequisites](prerequisites.md). The record includes public service URLs.
Live acceptance still requires actual credentials, provisioned slots and separate
baseline/revocation evidence; the manifest alone does not establish those outcomes.

Public-deployment acceptance uses that deployment's services, accepted issuer, and
compatible CLI/SDK versions. Local development uses a running local fleet and can
use development credentials. Record which environment was tested; a local result
does not certify public-deployment compatibility.

## Who owns what

| Artifact | Owns |
|---|---|
| Binary distribution | Versioned `tasra-cli` archives, checksums and signatures, with per-OS instructions |
| Deployment record | Canonical addresses, public RPC / verifier-agent / service endpoints, compatible CLI and SDK versions, funding and issuer instructions |
| `tasra-cli` | Real account and slot operations, commit/reveal, funding and diagnostics |
| `tasra-sdk` | The wallet protocol, encryption / decryption / signing integrations, and the agent skills |

The deployment handoff must link CLI archives for Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS aarch64 and
Windows x86_64, each with `SHA256SUMS` and a signature bundle.

## Public-deployment acceptance procedure

1. Download the pinned CLI binary and verify it against the release checksum.
2. Install the SDK:

   ```sh
   npm install tasra-sdk viem
   npm audit signatures        # registry signatures and available provenance
   ```

3. Fund a developer account and create a BLS slot, following the deployment's own
   guide. Keep the manifest and the slot outputs — you need the slot id, and the rule
   salt if you will provision a rule.
4. Verify the deployment before trusting anything on top of it: the CLI's cluster
   verification checks chain-derived keeper endpoints, the group key and the epoch
   agree with what the registry says.
5. Receive a credential from the deployed issuer, then do a live decryption —
   `examples/getting-started.ts`, shipped in the npm package, exercises threshold
   decryption using a provisioned non-exportable slot and your credential.
6. Revoke through the issuer, wait for the documented propagation/token-expiry
   window, and re-run the same threshold operation. **Record that refusal as a
   separate result**: a revocation nobody tested is not a revocation that works.

No command silently creates an alternative service or falls back to a local network.
Missing configuration is a prerequisite failure, and it says which prerequisite.

## What a green build does and does not prove

`npm run ci` proves the package is coherent: it compiles, the hermetic suites pass, the
package declarations and packed-package imports pass validation.
`npm run verify:consumers` separately installs the tarball and checks the runnable
offline README example, browser types, Vite, Webpack, Next.js, and browser crypto.

It proves **nothing about a network**. Real acceptance is steps 4–6 above, run against
actual credentials, with each outcome recorded separately. A green build or a plausible
UI is not acceptance of network behaviour.

## What you need from the deployment operator

The SDK and the CLI are self-service; three things are not, and they gate steps 3–6:

- **The deployment configuration** — use the published manifest and pointer for
  contract addresses, chain ID, service URLs and SHA-256. The SDK reads it through
  `parsePinnedNetworkManifest`. Select an RPC for that chain and discover the slot's
  keeper/verifier endpoints on-chain; ask the operator for any missing configuration.
- **The first credential.** Issuing one needs issuer access, so the operator either
  issues it to your holder DID or enrolls you as an issuer. Everything after that —
  presenting, renewing, revoking — is yours.
- **A slot's clear DCQL rule.** The creator can use `provisionRule` with its own
  signature on compatible fleets. No operator secret is needed. Keep the rule and salt
  before creation; until provisioning completes, keepers refuse operations.

One CLI gap worth knowing before you plan an evaluation: the released binary has
`slot protect`, `keys provision-rule`, `keys verify-cluster`, the `tasra` operations and
support diagnostics, but **no** `init`, `doctor`, `network use` or single end-to-end
slot-setup command.

## Where to go next

After the first proof: identity scopes and wildcards, sealed file storage, wallet
presentation from the Tasra extension or a mobile wallet, then a separate FROST
signing slot. Each recipe should carry an independently verified success, an expected
refusal, readable code, and a short redacted evidence report.
