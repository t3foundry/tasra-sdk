  // The deploy creates one vesting vault per tranche, so the tranche is
  // explicit: there is no "the vault" to default to.
  //
  // Two tranches can resolve to the same address when the book only carries
  // the bare `TasraVestingVault` key (see `requireVaultAddress`). Anything that
  // AGGREGATES across tranches must therefore de-duplicate on `address()` first,
  // or it reports a multiple of the real locked supply.
  /**
   * Read one view function across many argument lists - the registry fan-out, and the
   * only place in this client where the number of round trips is worth engineering.
   *
   * Where Multicall3 is deployed the whole list is one `eth_call` per chunk; where it is
   * not, the reads are issued CONCURRENTLY rather than in a loop, so they overlap
   * instead of queueing. Which mode is in use comes from a single cached
   * {@link multicallAddress} probe, never from an assumption about the chain.
   *
   * Why it matters: a 10k-operator registry is ~40,000 view calls, which as sequential
   * round trips is tens of minutes on any real RPC.
   *
   * A failing item is `null` in place - one unreadable operator must not blank the whole
   * set. Pass `allowFailure: false` where POSITION carries meaning (an ordered operator
   * set, whose indexes shift if one item is dropped); that rejects instead.
