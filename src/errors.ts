// Error taxonomy.
//
// Before this existed the SDK threw bare `Error` from ~90 sites, so the only way
// to tell "the JWT was denied" from "the node is unreachable" from "not enough
// nodes answered" was to regex `err.message`. The SDK was doing that to itself in
// node-client.ts. Message-matching breaks on any wording change, and it cannot
// carry structure - a caller that wants the HTTP status, or the per-node reasons
// behind a failed assembly, had nowhere to read them from.
//
// Every class here extends `Error`, so existing `catch (e) { e.message }` code is
// unaffected; the messages keep their previous shape too. What's new is that you
// can branch on the type and read fields off it:
//
// try {
// await session.decrypt(envelope)
// } catch (e) {
// if (e instanceof AuthDeniedError) return reclaimCredential() // never retry
// if (e instanceof ThresholdNotMetError) {
// console.warn(`only ${e.got}/${e.need} nodes answered:`, e.reasons)
// return retryLater() // transient
// }
// throw e
// }
//
// `retryable` is the coarse signal for callers that don't want to enumerate
// types: false means the request will fail identically on retry (a denied or
// expired credential, a malformed rule), true means it might not.
